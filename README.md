Entertainment Center
====================
This is a simple python project that dynamically creates a webpage (dans_flicks.html) from a list of objects (contained in entertainment_center.py). 

Getting Started
---------------
* Extract the Zip File into a directory, and execute the entertainment_center.py file to automatically generate several other files. 
* e.g. `python entertainment_center.py` 
* Python will try to automatically open the output file which will be located in the same directory as the project.
* This project requires Python 2.7.x to run.
